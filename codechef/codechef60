Debugging Task

A user attempts to merge two objects and overwrite a property, but the result is not as expected.

Debugging Instructions:

    Analyze why the theme property is not updated to "dark".

    Correct the code to prioritize userSettings over defaults.



const defaults = { theme: "light", notifications: true };
const userSettings = { theme: "dark" };

const finalSettings = { ...defaults, ...userSettings };
console.log(finalSettings);
