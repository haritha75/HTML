    Variables declared with let and const have block-level scope. This means they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are declared.
    Variables declared inside a block are not accessible outside that block.
    This is generally considered more predictable and less error-prone, especially in scenarios involving loops and asynchronous code.

  function example() {
  if (true) {
    let y = 20;
    const z = 30;
  }
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
  console.log(z); // ReferenceError: z is not defined
}
