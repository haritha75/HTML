    1. Variables declared with var have function-level scope. This means they are only accessible within the function in which they are declared.
    2. If a variable is declared inside a block (like a loop or conditional statement), it is still accessible throughout the entire function.
    3. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with asynchronous code or loops.

  function example() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 10;
  }
  console.log(x); // x is accessible here
}
